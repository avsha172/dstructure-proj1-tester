# dstructure-proj1-tester
if there is an error a avl_error_log.txt file will be created with the traceback of the error and information about the error + the tree that caused the error which will be converted to string.
if the error occurs in the keeping correct pointers to children nodes the conversion of the tree to a string might raise errors and will surely show an incorrect representation of the tree.

the following methods are used in the tester you should to your tree for it to work, there might be more methods i dont remember though:
node.is_real_node
